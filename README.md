# Recommendations to use this repo
!! Disclaimer, this is a very raw set of lines of code to ease your life in case of need!!
* Clone this repo
* Download [pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) as IDE
* Import the cloned repo into pycharm and define a venv (no, I haven't packaged yet this repo!)
* Let the IDE import the missing module (same reason as above)
